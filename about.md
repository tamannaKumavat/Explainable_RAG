## Why Interpretability is Important

Interpretability in machine learning and AI systems is crucial for building trust, understanding decisions, and ensuring fairness and transparency. As AI models become increasingly complex (e.g., neural networks, transformer-based models), their decision-making processes become harder to interpret, leading to concerns about:

1. **Bias Detection**: Interpretability helps identify biases in the model, which is critical for applications like hiring, loan approvals, and healthcare.
2. **Trust and Accountability**: For businesses and regulators, understanding why a model makes specific decisions ensures accountability and builds trust with users.
3. **Debugging and Improvement**: Interpretable models allow data scientists and developers to detect and correct errors or inefficiencies in the model.
4. **Ethical Compliance**: In domains like finance and healthcare, interpretability is essential for complying with regulations like GDPR and ensuring ethical AI usage.

In mathematical terms, an interpretable model aims to reduce the black-box behavior of machine learning systems:

$$
\text{Model Output} = f(\text{Input Data}) \implies \text{Understandable } f(\cdot)
$$

where $$\ f(\cdot) $$ represents the underlying decision logic. Making $$\ f(\cdot) $$ transparent bridges the gap between predictions and human understanding.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines information retrieval with natural language generation. Instead of relying solely on a pre-trained language model to answer queries, RAG systems first retrieve relevant chunks of information and then use them to generate accurate and context-specific answers.

### Key Steps in RAG:
1. **Document Processing**: Break down large documents into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., sentences or paragraphs).
2. **Information Retrieval**:
   - Use a database or embedding-based similarity search (e.g., ChromaDB) to find the most relevant chunks for a given query.
   - This process ensures that the model retrieves grounded, factual information before generating responses.
3. **Answer Generation**:
   - Feed the retrieved chunks as context into a powerful language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to generate the final answer.

### RAG Equation:

The RAG model can be represented as:
$$
\text{Response} = g(h(Q, C))
$$
Where:
- \( Q \): User's query.
- \( C \): Retrieved context chunks.
- \( h(Q, C) \): Retrieval function that selects the most relevant chunks from the database.
- \( g(h(Q, C)) \): Generation function that synthesizes the final response using the retrieved context.

## How This App Works

This app is designed to demonstrate the power of RAG and help users interpret the model's behavior using advanced visualization techniques. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **PDF Upload**:
   - Users can upload a PDF document containing text data.
   - The app extracts the text from the document for further processing.

2. **Chunking**:
   - The extracted text is split into smaller chunks using either fixed-size or sentence-based chunking techniques.
   - Chunking ensures that the retrieval process is efficient and granular.

3. **Retrieval**:
   - When a query is entered, the app retrieves the most relevant chunks using embedding-based similarity search.
   - These embeddings are generated using OpenAI's advanced embedding models, ensuring semantic understanding.

4. **Response Generation**:
   - The retrieved chunks are used as context to generate a concise and accurate response using OpenAI GPT models.

5. **t-SNE Plot**:
   - The embeddings of the chunks, query, and response are visualized in a t-SNE plot, which reduces high-dimensional data into two dimensions for better interpretability.

## How t-SNE Plots Help

t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique that helps visualize high-dimensional data. In this app, t-SNE is used to project embeddings of the chunks, query, and response into a 2D space. This visualization helps in:

1. **Understanding Query Relevance**:
   - The proximity of the query embedding to the chunk embeddings shows how well the retrieval system works.

2. **Response Validation**:
   - If the response embedding is close to the retrieved chunks, it indicates that the model is generating answers based on relevant information.

3. **Cluster Identification**:
   - The plot can reveal clusters of semantically similar chunks, helping identify patterns or redundancies in the data.

### t-SNE Cost Function:
t-SNE minimizes the divergence between two probability distributions: one that measures pairwise similarities in the original space and another in the low-dimensional space:
$$
\text{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_{i \neq j} P_{ij} \log \frac{P_{ij}}{Q_{ij}}
$$
Where:
- \( P_{ij} \): Pairwise similarity in the high-dimensional space.
- \( Q_{ij} \): Pairwise similarity in the reduced low-dimensional space.

This optimization ensures that similar points in the original space remain close in the visualization.
