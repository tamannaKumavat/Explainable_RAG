## Why Interpretability Matters

As AI models grow more complex, understanding how they make decisions becomes essential. Interpretability helps us:

1. **Spot Biases** – Important in fields like hiring, finance, and healthcare.
2. **Build Trust** – Users and stakeholders need to know why decisions are made.
3. **Improve Models** – Helps developers debug and fine-tune performance.
4. **Meet Ethical Standards** – Comply with laws like GDPR and support responsible AI.

At its core, interpretability means making the model’s internal function understandable:

$$
\text{Model Output} = f(\text{Input Data}) \implies \text{Understandable } f(\cdot)
$$

where $$\ f(\cdot) $$ represents the underlying decision logic. Making $$\ f(\cdot) $$ transparent bridges the gap between predictions and human understanding.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines information retrieval with natural language generation. Instead of relying solely on a pre-trained language model to answer queries, RAG systems first retrieve relevant chunks of information and then use them to generate accurate and context-specific answers.

### Key Steps in RAG:
1. **Document Processing**: Break down large documents into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., sentences or paragraphs).
2. **Information Retrieval**:
   - Use a database or embedding-based similarity search (e.g., ChromaDB) to find the most relevant chunks for a given query.
   - This process ensures that the model retrieves grounded, factual information before generating responses.
3. **Answer Generation**:
   - Feed the retrieved chunks as context into a powerful language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to generate the final answer.

### RAG Equation:

The RAG model can be represented as:
$$
\text{Response} = g(h(Q, C))
$$
Where:
- \( Q \): User's query.
- \( C \): Retrieved context chunks.
- \( h(Q, C) \): Retrieval function that selects the most relevant chunks from the database.
- \( g(h(Q, C)) \): Generation function that synthesizes the final response using the retrieved context.

## How This App Works

This app is designed to demonstrate the power of RAG and help users interpret the model's behavior using advanced visualization techniques. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **PDF Upload**:
   - Users can upload a PDF document containing text data.
   - The app extracts the text from the document for further processing.

2. **Chunking**:
   - The extracted text is split into smaller chunks using either fixed-size or sentence-based chunking techniques.
   - Chunking ensures that the retrieval process is efficient and granular.

3. **Retrieval**:
   - When a query is entered, the app retrieves the most relevant chunks using embedding-based similarity search.
   - These embeddings are generated using OpenAI's advanced embedding models, ensuring semantic understanding.

4. **Response Generation**:
   - The retrieved chunks are used as context to generate a concise and accurate response using OpenAI GPT models.

5. **t-SNE Plot**:
   - The embeddings of the chunks, query, and response are visualized in a t-SNE plot, which reduces high-dimensional data into two dimensions for better interpretability.

## How t-SNE Plots Help

t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique that helps visualize high-dimensional data. In this app, t-SNE is used to project embeddings of the chunks, query, and response into a 2D space. This visualization helps in:

1. **Understanding Query Relevance**:
   - The proximity of the query embedding to the chunk embeddings shows how well the retrieval system works.

2. **Response Validation**:
   - If the response embedding is close to the retrieved chunks, it indicates that the model is generating answers based on relevant information.

3. **Cluster Identification**:
   - The plot can reveal clusters of semantically similar chunks, helping identify patterns or redundancies in the data.

### t-SNE Cost Function:
t-SNE minimizes the divergence between two probability distributions: one that measures pairwise similarities in the original space and another in the low-dimensional space:
$$
\text{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_{i \neq j} P_{ij} \log \frac{P_{ij}}{Q_{ij}}
$$
Where:
- \( P_{ij} \): Pairwise similarity in the high-dimensional space.
- \( Q_{ij} \): Pairwise similarity in the reduced low-dimensional space.

This optimization ensures that similar points in the original space remain close in the visualization.
